# Below are all the sections and options you can have in ~/.streamlit/config.toml.

[global]

# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWatchdogWarning = false

# Configure the ability to share apps to the cloud.
# Should be set to one of these values: - "off" : turn off sharing. - "s3" : share to S3, based on the settings under the [s3] section of this config file.
# Default: "off"
sharingMode = "off"

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via "python my_script.py".
# Default: true
showWarningOnDirectExecution = true

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'

[client]

# Whether to enable st.cache.
# Default: true
caching = true

# If false, makes your Streamlit script not draw to a Streamlit app.
# Default: true
displayEnabled = true


[runner]

# Allows you to type a variable or string by itself in a single line of Python code to write it to the app.
# Default: true
magicEnabled = true

# Install a Python tracer to allow you to stop or pause your script at any point and introspect it. As a side-effect, this slows down your script's execution.
# Default: false
installTracer = false

# Sets the MPLBACKEND environment variable to Agg inside Streamlit to prevent Python crashing.
# Default: true
fixMatplotlib = true


[server]

# List of folders that should not be watched for changes. Relative paths will be taken as relative to the current working directory.
# Example: ['/home/user1/env', 'relative/path/to/folder']
# Default: []
folderWatchBlacklist = ['']

# Change the type of file watcher used by Streamlit, or turn it off completely.
# Allowed values: * "auto" : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and falls back to polling if watchdog is not available. * "watchdog" : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module. * "poll" : Force Streamlit to always use polling. * "none" : Streamlit will not watch files.
# Default: "auto"
fileWatcherType = "auto"

# Symmetric key used to produce signed cookies. If deploying on multiple replicas, this should be set to the same value across all replicas to ensure they all share the same secret.
# Default: randomly generated secret key.

# If false, will attempt to open a browser window on start.
# Default: false unless (1) we are on a Linux box where DISPLAY is unset, or (2) server.liveSave is set.
headless = true

# Immediately share the app in such a way that enables live monitoring, and post-run analysis.
# Default: false
liveSave = false

# Automatically rerun script when the file is modified on disk.
# Default: false
runOnSave = false

# The address where the server will listen for client and browser connections. Use this if you want to bind the server to a specific address. If set, the server will only be accessible from this address, and not from any aliases (like localhost).
# Default: (unset)
#address =

# The port where the server will listen for client and browser connections.
# Default: 8501
port = 80

# The base path for the URL where Streamlit should be served from.
# Default: ""

# Enables support for Cross-Origin Request Sharing, for added security.
# Default: true
enableCORS = false

# Enables support for Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) protection, for added security.
# Due to conflicts between CORS and XSRF, if `server.enableXsrfProtection` is on and `server.enableCORS` is off at the same time, we will prioritize `server.enableXsrfProtection`.
# Default: true
enableXsrfProtection = false

# Enables support for websocket compression.
# Default: true

[mapbox]

# Default: ""
token = ""

[deprecation]

# Set to false to disable the deprecation warning for the file uploader encoding.
# Default: "True"
